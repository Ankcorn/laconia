## FAQ

1.  I already am using another framework like Serverless Framework or SAM, why should I use laconia?

    Tools like Serverless Framework or SAM are more focused on helping the
    build and deployment of your application. Laconia however is more focused on
    how you craft your application. In fact, both tools can be used together and
    can be seen in action in [laconia's acceptance test](packages/laconia-acceptance-test).
